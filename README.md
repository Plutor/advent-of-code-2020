# Advent of Code 2020

I'm trying to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Thoughts on Rust so far

* It is obviously built to be a very _safe_ language.
* Text manipulation is a chore.
* Regexps and crates and cargo make it hard to just bang out code.
* `HashMap.entry()` is a hell of a lot of fun.
* I like the way it figures out generic types based on later use.
* `match` is great.
* Oh no, the fact that you need to leave off the trailing semicolon for a return statement from a brace. :( :(
